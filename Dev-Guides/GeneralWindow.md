# General Window

The General Window is where (for the most part) information loaded from the general options will be displayed.

General options are the general related tasks that Players will have access to while progressing through the game.
These options are currently:

- Profile
- Upgrades
- Inventory
- Shop

## Profile

The profile window will display the information for the player, and will include the following:

- Player Stats (Refer to concepts/Features/Core)
- Player Gear (Weapon and armour)

Additional information will be viewable by running the !profile command.

## Upgrades

This window is where the player will be able to upgrade their stats using Paradians, up to a cap.
Listed in this window will be:

- List of Valid Upgradable stats
- The cap for each stat, along with the price to upgrade the stat by 1.
- The commands needed to be run to facilitate the upgrades

## Inventory

The inventory window will display the list of items available for the player separated by tier.
This includes:

- The Item (Maybe an Icon if I feel fancy)
- Commands needed to get info, use or sell the item.

## Shop

This window will be where Players may look at items separated by Types.
Initially, a mini menu will appear containing the following options:

- Armour
- Weapons
- Items
- Abilities / Passives

Interacting with one of these menu buttons, will bring up the shop for that type, which will include:

- The Item (Maybe an Icon if I have patience)
- The Price
- Commands needed to get more information and buy the item.
