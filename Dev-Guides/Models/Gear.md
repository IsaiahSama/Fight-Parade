# Gear

Gear refers to Armour and Weapons.
Some Armour and Weapons are made from similar materials. These ones have an additional synergy effect, if both are equipped at the same time, sometimes even granting a unique skill.

There are various different equipment, allowing users to pick and choose what they want to get the effects they may desire.

As of now, equipment is classless.

## Skills

Attributes for skills are:

- name
- id
- description
- tooltip
- effect
- cost
- tier
- reborn

## Weapons

Weapons focus on providing a way for players to increase their damage by a substantial amount.

Stats that Weapons can effect include:

- Power
- crit chance
- crit damage
- lifesteal

## Armour

Armour focuses on providing Health and defense.

Stats that Armour can effect include:

- Health
- power
- regen

Armour also has a special attribute "pairs".

### Pairs

Some armours contain a pair attribute containing the ID of a weapon. When this armour set and paired weapon are equipped at the same time, the set gains a synergy, and provides a bonus effect. The bonus effect varies greatly.
While being able to mix and match for various effects sounds cool, it also sounds like a pain to code, so each Armour will either have one, or no paired weapon.
