# Overview

This folder will contain the information for the models, needed to make the game actually function. In Summary, these will be:

- Character (Players & Enemies)

## Reference Information

## Effect

For skills, items, and gear, there will be an attribute called "effect". This will be a dictionary, mapping stat names, to an amount to increase, decrease or multiply by.

The exact values for this dictionary will vary, and will be discussed in the respective MD files

## Reborn

Some skills, items and gear are locked behind players being reborn a certain number of times. The reborn value indicates the minimum reborn level a player must have before they can see / obtain an item.
