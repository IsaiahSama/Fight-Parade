# Action Buttons

Action buttons refer to the Quest, Job and Train buttons, provided to the user. These allow the user to engage in each of these tasks.

Quests puts the player against enemies for exp, currency and other rewards.
Job lets the player take it easy and complete a non-combat task for currency and little exp.
Train, might actually deprecate this one, don't see a place for it but for now will leave it there.

## Activating

When the player presses an Action Button, they will be replaced by Task Buttons until the selected task is complete.
