# UI!

I do have the wireframe linked, but just in case you wanted to kinda see how the UI evolves, I'll just have images here in this folder.

Since I'm not really a designer, I doubt I'll change the design much from the first draft. If that's the case, then I'll just remove this folder so it doesn't take up unnecessary space XD

## Images

Wireframe 1 - The first draft of the Wireframe

Screenshot 1 - Just the core raw HTML
Screenshot 2 - Positioning the elements
Screenshot 3 - Sizing the elements "correctly" for the most part.
