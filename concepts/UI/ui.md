# UI!

I do have the wireframe linked, but just in case you wanted to kinda see how the UI evolves, I'll just have images here in this folder.

Since I'm not really a designer, I doubt I'll change the design much from the first draft. If that's the case, then I'll just remove this folder so it doesn't take up unnecessary space XD

## Images

Wireframe 1 - The first draft of the Wireframe
Wireframe Stats - The draft for the layout of Player stats

Screenshot 1 - Just the core raw HTML
Screenshot 2 - Positioning the elements
Screenshot 3 - Sizing the elements "correctly" for the most part.
Screenshot 4 - Added Stat Window
Screenshot 5 - Added Chat Window
Screenshot 6 - Added dummy text and sorted out stylings.
Screenshot 7 - Added darker theme. I'll clean it up eventually
