# UI!

I do have the [wireframe linked](https://wireframe.cc/Jqsp9i), but just in case you wanted to kinda see how the UI evolves, I'll just have images here in this folder.

Since I'm not really a designer, I doubt I'll change the design much from the first draft. If that's the case, then I'll just remove this folder so it doesn't take up unnecessary space XD

## /Images/

This folder contains the images for the UI changes and wireframe.
