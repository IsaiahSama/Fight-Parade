# Overview

A text based Action Adventure RPG game, where you can go on quests, complete jobs, acquire gear with special effects, and battle against various enemies and other players!

## Style

The game being text based simply refers to the main method for which information will be displayed to the user.
Ideally, in the form of a chat window. However, some buttons and icons will be present for certain features such as Quests, Jobs and Inventory, to make things easier instead of having to memorize a whole list of commands.

## Wireframe

~~As with most of my other web projects, I will be including the Wireframe for the UI when I start working on it.~~
With the core features completed, I can now start working on what the UI will roughly look like.

## About this folder.

As mentioned in the README.md file, the game had a good amount of features to it, as I most likely went a bit overboard as it was the first publicly accessible game I actually ever made. This folder will serve as a place for me to keep track of the features I've added / want to add, to make the development process go a bit more focused.

## Technology

This project will be built using my FSH (pronounced fish) stack, which makes use of:
Flask for the backend, SQLAlchemy for the database (I'll probably start with sqlite, then upgrade after), and HTMX for the frontend.

P.S I HEREBY CLAIM THE TERM FSH STACK!!
