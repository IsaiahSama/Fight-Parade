# Events, Adventures and Raid Battles.

These three (3) features involve multiple players at the same time, essentially PvE (Players vs environment)

## Events

Events are in game special events that affects all current players. These are generally boosts or buffs given to players for a set duration, such as increased damage, exp or paradians.

## Raid battles

Raid battles are a type of Combat event where multiple players are allowed to gather together to face a Raid Beast (a larger stronger enemy). The rewards from raids are far greater than what can be received from quests, but comes with an equally greater amount of danger.

## Adventures

Players may form teams with other members and engage in adventures. Adventures are AFK quests that teams may go on together for a set amount of time. It exists as a "why not" kinda feature.
