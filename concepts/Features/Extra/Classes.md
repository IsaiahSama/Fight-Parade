# Classes

Classes are ironically one of the last thing to be added to the original game. There are currently three (3) main types of classes, each having different perks with regard to stats, abilities, and synergies with their respective weapons. I'm not yet certain whether I should class lock weapons or not. Based on how development goes, I might end up doing just that.

Feel free to refer to the Guides/Abilities/ folder for more insight on the abilities.

## Extra

You must have noticed by now that this isn't a Core feature. This may change depending on how I feel about development. If it does become a core feature, then I promise to flesh it out some more.
