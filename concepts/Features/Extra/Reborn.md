# Reborn / Return to Zero

When players reach the highest tier, they gain the ability to be "Return to Zero". This sets the player's level back to zero. When Reborn, the player gets to keep an additional percentage of their previous stats, up to a maximum cap, so they will have a bit of an advantage. Reborn players also gain access to new abilities and passives depending on their reborn levels.

There is currently no cap on the number of time a player can be reborn, however for balance reasons, interactions with other players will have to be modified.

## Stat changes

The exact values for the stat changes are subject to change, however from the original game, they are:

- Health: 170 + ((0.01 + (Reborn level / 100)) \* Previous health)
- Power: 15 + ((0.03 + (Reborn Level / 100)) \* Previous power)
