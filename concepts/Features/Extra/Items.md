# Items

I felt a bit unsure about whether Items should be considered a core feature or not, since they are the main reason why the inventory exists.

Items refer to one time consumables, which provide a buff to the player for a certain duration (either several turns in battle, or a given number of battles).

This will be explored more in the Guides documents.
