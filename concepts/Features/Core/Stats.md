## Upgrades

Upgrades are for the Player's stats. All of the stats listed under Player above are upgradable, increasing their amount in exchange for Paradian with a max cap per tier (except for level and exp).

## "Hidden Values"

Crit damage is calculated as + 15% of total damage (this includes any buff and weapons). As crit chance is increased, crit damage also scales from 15% up to a maximum of 35%.

Amount healed from heal chance is calculated as 3% of max health. As heal_chance is increased, the amount healed scales from 3% up to a maximum of 10% of max health.
