# IDs

There are various items and the like involved in this game. As such, there must be some unique way to identify each of them.

## Fighters

When a fighter / player is created, they will be assigned an available 10 digit number. I'll probably expand on that a bit more.

## Enemies

Enemies will have a unique 6 digit number, where the first digit is the tier, and the remaining 5 are the id.

## Items

Items, in this case referring to consumables, gear and skills will each have a unique 6 digit number, where the first number is an identifier for the type of item, the second is the tier the item is, and the last 4 are the unique ID.

### Consumables

IDs for consumables range from 110000 to 169999 (as they are currently six tiers).
