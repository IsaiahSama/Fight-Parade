# Levels

This docuument focuses a bit more on the leveling mechanic.

As expected, leveling increases the player's strength overtime, increasing their stats, and granting access to stronger equipment.

A player may level up by gaining enough Experience, and bursting through the Threshold for that level.

Players will gain experience by completing jobs and winning battles.

## Benefits of leveling up

As players defeat enemies, they gain a set amount of experience from that specific enemy, determined by the enemy's exp yield. The main thing that happens when a player levels up, is that they gain an overall increase in stats. This is given as a range base value per stat, which are listed out as follows:

Health: + (5 to 12)
Power: + (2 to 5)
Defense: + (1 to 3)

Crit and Heal chance are only increased by level up once every 20 levels. At that point, the increase is as follows:

Crit Chance: + (3 to 6)
Heal Chance: + (1 to 4)
