# Tiers

Most features of the game are divided into tiers. Tiers affect the type and amount of rewards received from quests and jobs, along with what items and gear are available to be bought.

As a player advances through the tiers, the shop will expand, revealing to them more powerful gear and items, the enemies fought in quests will get progressively more difficult, and different abilities and passives will make themselves available.

## Effects of Tiers

- Available gear
- Available items
- Strength of enemies
- Rewards from quests and jobs
- Available abilities and passives
- Increase cap on stats.

Tiers are defined by the level of the player.

## The Tiers

Tier 1 - < Level 50
Tier 2 - < Level 100
Tier 3 - < Level 150
Tier 4 - < Level 200
Tier 5 - > Level 200
Tier 6 - > Level 200 & > 10000 health

As the game is developed further, the requirements for each tier, and the number of tiers are subject to change.
