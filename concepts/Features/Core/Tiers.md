# Tiers

Most features of the game are divided into tiers. Tiers affect the type and amount of rewards received from quests and jobs, along with what items and gear are available to be bought.

As a player advances through the tiers, the shop will expand, revealing to them more powerful gear and items, the enemies fought in quests will get progressively more difficult, and different abilities and passives will make themselves available.
