# Quests, Jobs, Train and Fight

Quest, Jobs, Training and Fighting are essentially the core, core gameplay features used by Fight parade. Through these four (4) activities, the player is able to gain strength and Paradians, unlock new tiers, weapons, abilities and more.

## Train

Starting with the simplest of the 4, training allows the player to increase a stat (Damage, Health, heal chance and crit chance), by a low amount up to a threshold. When the player reaches that threshold for the stat, they will be unable to train it anymore unless they engage in a battle.

## Jobs

Next, are jobs. These are non-combat quests, where the player will primarily earn Paradians, or consumable items.

## Quests / Fight

On Quests, the player will advance out into the lands and engage in combat with an enemy. This will be the main way for the player to improve their skills and get stronger.
Fights are similar to quests, but is simply PvP. Refer to the Tiers.md document for a bit more insight into the process.
