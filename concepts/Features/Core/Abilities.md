# Abilities and Passives

Abilities and passives are special skills obtainable by players when they reach a certain level. They provide various extra effects in combat.

## How to get one

When they player first reaches the level where abilities / passives become available to them, they will be assigned a random one from Tier 1. As the player increases in levels and through tiers, different abilities will become available for them to choose from. Changing their ability / passive can be done in exchange for a moderate to large amount of Paradians.

Note: Abilities and passives are not unique to players, and as such, higher tiered enemies will have them as well.

## How they work

### Abilities

Abilties (may also be referred to as Actives) are skills which have a chance to be activated during battles, as long as they aren't on cooldown. Generic cooldown for abilities is four (4) turns, however, the higher tiered abilities will have their own cooldown timers.

### Passives

Passives, are skills which always "active" in battle, and generally affects the user's stats, or inflict effects upon the enemy.
