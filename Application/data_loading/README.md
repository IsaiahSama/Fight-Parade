# Data Loading

This folder will be reserved for mass loading data into the database used by the game.
You can modify the contents of the various files within the /data/ folder within this folder to add custom items to the game!
Just be sure to leave the first line of the file untouched, and follow the provided format.

Note:
While most of these are individual, for each enemy you create in the "enemies.txt" file, you must also include its stats in the "stats.txt" file. What will link them together is the id, so make sure the ids are the same.

When you're ready to create them, just run the dataloader.py
